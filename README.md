## Description

CinemaSearch is a feature rich search engine for finding the latest movies and tv series.  Using the combined capabilities of The Movie Database API and StreamingAvailability API, users can search for all sorts of movies and tv, new and old, with a simple to follow search box.

### Deployed Site

The site is deployed at https://jdempe.github.io/CinemaSearch/.

### Usage

The primary usage of the website occurs at the top search bar, where the user can search for movies and tv series by title or by discovery, which lets the user add between 1 and 6 optional parameters to search for.  The more advanced discover search can also sort the results.

- The search results will display the title, rating, and a brief description of the media.
- The user can click on the media results to view more details.
  - Trailer
  - Runtime
  - Rating
  - Release Date
  - Streaming availability
    - Clicking on the images takes you to the streaming service!
  - Cast and Crew
  - Genres

The user can also click on the checkbox in the upper corner of the media cards to add them to their favorites/watchlist. The watchlist is stored in local storage, so the user can come back to the site and see their watchlist at any time.  Clicking on the checkbox again will remove the media from the watchlist.

The last big feature is the banner, which displays random quotes from AFI's 100 Quotes for 100 Years list.  Clicking on the quote will search for the movie it is from.

### User Interface

The top banner and an example search result are seen below.  The results by default are trending movies from the last week and that is what is shown here.

Clicking on the Favorites button on the left of the screen slides out the Favorites menu.  The user can scroll through the saved media seeing the same cards from the search result.

Clicking on any media card brings up the media modal.  This is an exmaple of what that looks like, with the streaming availability icons shown.
